# RogueRealLifeLike

A basic implementation of an ASCII rogue-like game in Java for Android mobile but utilising augmented reality. The quirk behind this project is that users move around the game world by taking steps in real life while holding their phone to display what is around them.

The extension of this game is to allow users to map out the entire area they would like to "play" in, and the game adjusts accordingly. Currently the game has boundaries, enemies, and treasure chests the player can interact with. Maps can be adjusted by the developer via a simple text file system.
